This network protocol&amp;rsquo;s main focus is to collect IP traffic information and export it for monitoring purposes. A router configured to collect NetFlow will aggregate data packets into what is known as a flow, which is basically a summary of the traffic passing through the device in a given time span. Of the multiple iterations of the NetFlow protocol that Cisco has produced, two have cemented themselves as the most commonly used protocols: NetFlow v5 and NetFlow v9.</description></item></channel></rss>
