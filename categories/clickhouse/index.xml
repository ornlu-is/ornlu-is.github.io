I was in need of creating a Clickhouse container to attach to another application that would write to it. And I found myself thinking: it would be really convenient if there were a way to create a Clickhouse container that already comes with a set of tables created. Most of the solutions I found only were severely convoluted and relied on scripts to make this happen, so I thought that there must surely be a better way.</description></item></channel></rss>
