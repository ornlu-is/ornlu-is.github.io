created a Kubernetes clusters using microk8s; created a very simple Golang web server and its Docker image; created a Kubernetes deployment for the web server and a service to expose it. In this post, we will improve on the Docker image we previously built because we can always do better and that is the point of this whole series: each post must represent an improvement on the previous post, either by enhancing capabilities or employing better practices.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in Overengineering 1: deploying a Golang web server</title><link>https://ornlu-is.github.io/overengineering_adventures_1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 20:46:20 +0000</pubDate><author>Luís Franco</author><guid>https://ornlu-is.github.io/overengineering_adventures_1/</guid><description>There is a wide variety of blog posts on the internet teaching one how to create a simple web server in Golang. But most of them are incredibly boring and minor variations of each other. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a different approach: I&amp;rsquo;m going to deploy a simple REST API in Golang.
