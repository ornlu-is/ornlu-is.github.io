After a few posts, I had to archive that series. I was not pleased with the result, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; enough. Last time, I began this adventure by running a Kubernetes instance on my laptop. This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone deeper into the overengineering madness. Keep in mind that the end goal is still to deploy a very basic Golang web server.</description></item></channel></rss>
