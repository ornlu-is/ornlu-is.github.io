As such, I thought this was an appropriate time to refresh my Salt knowledge, which is an event-driven framework/automation tool whose name probably derives from the high blood pressure it induces whenever it is used to perform changes on production environment machines.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in Overengineering 2: Installing an Operating System</title><link>https://ornlu-is.github.io/overengineering_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 21:40:34 +0100</pubDate><author>Luís Franco</author><guid>https://ornlu-is.github.io/overengineering_2/</guid><description>Now that I have some hardware available, I need to install an operating system on these machines so that I can then install some software that will enable me to actually do something with these things. Since I do not want to have to connect a monitor to these machines every time I need to use them, I also have to set up some type of remote access.

After a few posts, I had to archive that series. I was not pleased with the result, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; enough. Last time, I began this adventure by running a Kubernetes instance on my laptop. This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone deeper into the overengineering madness. Keep in mind that the end goal is still to deploy a very basic Golang web server.</description></item></channel></rss>
