As a first step for this project, I am beginning by building a NetFlow v5 generator. This requires me to understand its structure and fields.

Each netflow v5 datagram has two parts:
* a header
* a set of flow records

The header has the following format:

something

where each field is ...

and each record has the following format

something

where each field is ...

dockerize the app

run it

capture with nfdump or wireshark
