Classless Internet Domain Routing, or CIDR, is notation used to define subnetworks, which is composed of an IP address followed by a forward slash and a number between zero and thirty two, e.g., 6.6.6.0/24. From a given CIDR, we can extract some information about the subnetwork: Network ID - this is what allows us to identify the network and corresponds to the IP address represented in the CIDR. In the example CIDR given above, this would be 6.6.6.0; Broadcast IP - this is the IP address that is used to broadcast messages to IP addresses in the network and corresponds to the last IP address in the IP range. for our example, it would be 6.6.6.255; First useable host IP - obviously, the actual first IP is the network ID, but that IP is not useable. However, the IP immediately after that one can actually be used and, in the context of our example, it would 6.6.6.1; Last useable host IP - similartly to the first useable host IP, the actual last IP is not useable as a host, but the one immediately before it is! So, for our running example, the last useable host IP would be 6.6.6.255; Number of IP addresses - this is fairly easy to calculate from the CIDR notation. Simply take the number that follows the forward slash, subtract it to 32, then take the power of 2 of the corresponding result. E.g., $32 - 24 = 8$, $2^8 = 256$, so for a /24 subnetwork, we have 256 IP addresses.

Programmed in Go, it would take a user given CIDR, parse it, and then write that CIDR into a Postgres database. Most of the times, this program would work perfectly, as expected. But, sometimes, it would fail. For example, for the input “6.6.6.0/24”, the program would function normally, but, for the input “3.3.1.0/16”, Postgres would throw an error. Now, there are two possible places where this error might be coming from: either from the Go application or the Postgres database. The Postgres table where the data was being written had a column of type cidr. From inspecting the documentation on Postgres network address types, we see that we really only had two options for this: cidr or inet, with the main difference between the two of them being that cidr does not allow for non-zero bits to the right of the network mask. With this bit of information, it should already be obvious what was going on: “3.3.1.0/16” is not a proper CIDR! The correct CIDR for the network it is trying to represent would be “3.3.0.0/16”.

The code snippet responsible for checking the CIDRs looks something like this: func checkCIDR(givenCIDR string) (*net.IPNet, error) { addr, inet, err := net.ParseCIDR(givenCIDR) if err != nil { return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"error parsing CIDR: %w\", err) } return \u0026net.IPNet{ IP: addr, Mask: inet.Mask, }, nil } If you take this code snippet and try to run it with the improper CIDR “3.3.1.0./16”, you’ll see that the code runs without returning an error! This is because the ParseCIDR function of the net package infers the subnet the CIDR refers to even if it is not a proper CIDR. If you look carefully at its returned values, we get both an IP address and an IP subnet. The IP address will correspond to the IP address given in the, sometimes improper, CIDR while the IP network will correspond to the inferred network. Meaning that Go would calculate the inferred network, but when we returned the value, we would return the improper CIDR, which then led to a Postgres error.

Ultimately, this is more of a user experience question. I prefer forcing users to know what they are playing around with, so, in my opinion, the fix should be to reject all improper CIDRs. This means that, we need to change the function that checks the CIDR to the following: func checkCIDR(givenCIDR string) (*net.IPNet, error) { addr, inet, err := net.ParseCIDR(givenCIDR) if err != nil { return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"error parsing CIDR: %w\", err) } if !addr.Equal(inet.IP) { return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"invalid CIDR provided\") } return \u0026net.IPNet{ IP: addr, Mask: inet.Mask, }, nil } You might, obviously, not want to take the same approach to fix this as I did, and that is completely fine: there is no universally correct approach to tackle this bug.

The idea behind this pattern is fairly simple, we will have New become a variadic function which will accept any number of arguments of the type Option, which we define as: type Option func(*Person) Then, for every struct attribute that should have a default value, we implement a function of the following form: func WithAttributeName(attributeValue attributeType) Option { return func(p *Person) { p.AttributeName = attributeValue } } For our case, let us say we want all attributes except ID to have default values. In that case, we’d end up with something like: func WithName(name string) Option { return func(p *Person) { p.Name = name } } func WithAge(age int) Option { return func(p *Person) { p.Age = age } } func WithEmail(email string) Option { return func(p *Person) { p.Email = email } } func WithAddress(address string) Option { return func(p *Person) { p.Address = address } } Finally, all we need is adapt our New function to handle these other functions as parameters and to set some default values. This is simply boils down to creating the Person struct with the default values we want and then looping over and calling the given Options: func New(id int, opts ...Option) *Person { p := \u0026Person{ ID: id, Name: \"John Doe\", Age: 25, Email: \"johndoe@example.com\", Address: \"Nowhere\", } for _, opt := range opts { opt(p) } return p } Note that this method sets all attributes as optional except for the ID of the Person.

I am going to be using the image for Golang 1.19, to match the version I am running locally, and have the image simply build and run the application. FROM golang:1.19 ADD . /askeladden WORKDIR /askeladden RUN go build ENTRYPOINT ./askeladden Firstly, we have to build our image, which is as simple as being in the same directory of the Dockerfile and running docker build . -f Dockerfile -t 'not-so-slim-shady' docker build . -f Dockerfile -t 'not-so-slim-shady' When we give the Docker CLI the build command, we are telling it to build an image. Images are later used to create containers, which are running instances of a given image. The . refers to the path of the context, which, in the context (ha-ha, funny guy) of Docker, refers to the set of files that can be used by the build process. The -f is shorthand notation for --file and is the path to the Dockerfile, while -t is short for --tag and allows us to name/tag our image. In this case, I only named it. We can check our image by listing all images built by Docker using docker images: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE not-so-slim-shady latest 3673b4f2f4c8 14 seconds ago 1.07GB Great, the image is there and taking up 1.07GB! So now we have to create and run a container based on this image to check if our web server is working. This can be achieved by running: docker run -d -p 88:8090 not-so-slim-shady docker run -d -p 88:8090 not-so-slim-shady The run command creates and runs a container. The -d flag, which stands for --detach, will run the container in the background of the terminal, meaning it will not block the terminal window. Since the container has its own network, we have to expose the port 8090 where our web server can be accessed inside the container to outside the container. This is achieved by publishing the port and mapping it into a port on the host machine, i.e., my computer, with the -p flag followed by the specification of the host port and container port in the \u003chost_port\u003e:\u003ccontainer_port\u003e format. Finally, we specify the name of the image we want to build our container from which, in this case, is just not-so-slim-shady. Docker will first look for this image locally and, if it doesn’t find it, it will attempt to retrieve it from a public image repository. We can see the list of running containers by typing docker ps, and we can check that it is properly running by navigating to http://localhost:88/. So, now we’re fairly certain that our web server is containerized as desired, so we can stop the container using the docker stop \u003ccontainer_ID\u003e command (you can retrieve the container ID from the output of docker ps). Now the output of docker ps doesn’t show anything but the container wasn’t actually deleted, it was merely stopped. If we type docker ps -a, where -a stands for --all, we can see that our container is in an Exited status. To avoid taking up resources, let’s just delete it with docker rm \u003ccontainer_ID\u003e.

The reason the image is so large is because it has Golang installed, which we don’t actually require for any purpose after the web server is built. The idea is simple: we create a container with Golang 1.19 and build our binary, just as before. But after building it, we create another container, based on a Debian image, and simply inject our binary into it. We can then discard the container we used for building the web server and we are left with a slimmer Docker image. So the first step is to pick the Debian image that we’ll use. We have no special preference for the Debian version, so we can use the latest version, which is called bookworm. However, we will pick the bookworm-slim variant, which is a Debian bookworm version, but without extra files that aren’t usually required by containers, such as manual pages and documentation.

But convenience is on our side again because the pagination in OMDB always shows the last possible page we can navigate to! This means that, to get all pages for a given year, all we have to do is scrape the first one and extract the number of the last page. Then, the links all pages in between the first and last page can be obtained by simply incrementing /index/1 until we reach /index/\u003clastpage\u003e. Note that the list item for the last page does not contain any attribute that allows us to distinguish it from all others, but there is one list item that does, and that is the one corresponding to the next page, which always shows up after the link for the last page and has the attribute class with the value nextpage. So, in essence, we just need to locate the div element that has an id attribute with value pagination and, in its child elements, locate the li element with the attribute class and value nextpage and then get its previous sibling, that holds the information on the last page.

Then, all we need to do is fetch the value of the href attribute of the anchor element to get the portion of the link that we have to append to https://www.omdb.org to get a movie link and, additionally, we can also extract this element’s data to get the movie’s name. There is one last detail about extracting a movie link: sometimes, OMDB another hyperlink associated with each movie. If you look closely at the screenshot above, you can see that some movies’ name is prefixed by a small arrow. Unfortunately, this small arrow has the exact same hyperref value as the link we are interested, meaning that we get duplicated links. While we could solve this with a slightly more complicated scraping strategy, we can also tackle this by implementing deduplication which will be sufficiently efficient since the number of movies per page is small (max. 24).

In this context, a network is a set of actors, people, or things that are connected to each other via a relation. For example, in a social network, you are connected to your parents via a parental relation and connected to your friends via a friendship relation. Similarly, two computers can also form a network where they are connected via the Internet. Networks are a wonderful concept and they are absolutely everywhere. Networks are represented as graphs, which are a set of nodes and edges. We can visualise these in the following way: Kevin Bacon and his parents as a graph Hopefully, the above picture made it abundantly clear what a graph, nodes and edges are. In our graph we have three nodes, $|N|=3$, Kevin Bacon and his parents, and two edges, $|E|=2$, which connect Kevin Bacon to his parents via a parental relation. Mathematically, we characterise a graph, $G$, by its set of nodes, $N$, and edges, $E$, as follows: $$G(N, E),$$ where $$N = \\{ \\text{Edmund Bacon}, \\text{Kevin Bacon}, \\text{Ruth Hilda Bacon} \\},$$ $$E = \\{ \\{ \\text{Edmund Bacon} , \\text{Kevin Bacon} \\}, \\{ \\text{Kevin Bacon}, \\text{Ruth Hilda Bacon} \\} \\}.$$ Technically, the above graph should be a directed graph, in the sense that edges have a given direction: Edmund Bacon is Kevin Bacon’s father, but Kevin Bacon is not Edmund Bacon’s father, such shenanigans are left to time travel movies. However, for simplicity’s sake, I decided to represent the graph as an undirected graph, where edges represent bidirectional relations. Additionally, it is also an unweighted graph, meaning that all edges have the same weight, because I am assuming Kevin Bacon loves both his parents equally.

If we associate Kevin Bacon with $i=1$, and is mother and father with, respectively, $i=2$ and $i=3$, we have that: $k_1 = 2$; $k_2 = 1$; $k_3 = 1$. From a network’s degrees, we can calculate its average degree, a quantity that plays a central role in network analysis. This is given by the following formula: $$ \\langle k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|N|} k_i = \\frac{2|E|}{|N|}. $$ While the concept of a node’s degree is very intuitive, the concept of distance in a network is a tougher concept to handle, simply because it doesn’t necessarily translate nicely into reality. In networks, the distance between two nodes depends on the path that connects them. This path is simply the set of edges that we must transverse to go from one node to another, and, the number of edges transversed is the path length. Effectively, we equate the path length to the distance between two nodes. However, in most graphs, there isn’t a single path that connects two nodes together. As such, it is more natural to refer to the shortest path, i.e., the path that consists of the minimal set of edges. Derived from this, another interesting quantity in networks is the average path length, $\\langle d \\rangle$, which is simply the average of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.

He began by selecting a stock broker from Boston and a divinity student from Sharon (Massachussetts) as target nodes. Simultaneously, he also randomly selected residents of Wichita and Omaha, which would act as starting nodes. These residents were sent a letter by Milgram explaining the study’s objective, a photograph, the name, address and some more information about their target person. These letters also included instructions for these people to forward the letter to the person they knew and thought would most likely know the target person. While many of the letters did not make it back, those that did led allowed Milgram to calculate the median number of people required to reach the target. Surprisingly, the median number of intermediate acquaintances was 5, which is where the expression “six degrees of separation” and the concept of small world phenomenon stems from. In network terms, this just means that the average distance between two nodes in a network is short. More precisely, it is short enough that the approximation: $$\\langle d \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\ln |N|}{ \\ln \\langle k \\rangle },$$ is reasonably close.
